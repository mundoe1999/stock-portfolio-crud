# Stock Portfolio CRUD Project
## About
This is a fullstack assessment repository to showcase my skills in design,
implementation, and readability.

## How to Run
You would want to cd into both client and server, and yarn install. After doing so, you can simply yarn start to boot up either the client or the server.

Alternatively, you can view the app here: https://stocks-fellowship-app.herokuapp.com/
